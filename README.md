## ✍️ Reflection

As **str_vns**, I took on the role of a **Full Stack Developer** for this capstone project. I focused more on the **mobile development**, as I was the only one in the group confident enough to handle it. My groupmates supported me in some areas, such as design, but the core backend logic and integration were mostly handled by me—I contributed about **90% of the backend development** and in **Web development** i just implement the **realtime Notification and Message** and to **Login** because my groupmate cant do it and im only one that has idea to do it and cart i upgrade it and i add the **Online Payment** too in the cart navigation and i refactor some logic on the web .

Being the only one responsible for building the **real-time messaging system** was particularly challenging. It required complex logic, and I had no one to rely on for that part. But through the struggle, I gained a much deeper understanding of what it means to be a Full Stack Developer.

Through this project, I learned to work with:
- **Firebase notifications**
- **Mapbox**, **Here Maps**, and **OpenStreetMap**
- **Weatherbit API**
- **Secure user data handling**
- **PayMongo integration**
- **Asynchronous operations**
- **Debugging full-stack interactions**
- **Using AES-256-GCM**

One of the hardest tasks was integrating **OSM (OpenStreetMap)** through a WebView. While it may seem simple, making it function properly inside the app took significant effort and troubleshooting.

Another major challenge was integrating **PayMongo**. I read through their documentation, but it didn’t clearly explain the flow for combining `paymentIntent` and `paymentMethodResponse`. Unlike other groups who used a more basic implementation, I wanted to build it with a deeper understanding rather than just copying code.

The most difficult part was handling the **payment confirmation redirect** back to the app. I eventually realized it required a **deployed payment page** that would redirect to a **deep link** in the app after confirmation. Figuring this out took me several hours, but it was a great learning experience about payment integration and user flow.

As for **Mapbox**, it was easy to integrate initially, but the cost limitations were a concern. We had to stay within the **free tier**, which affected how much we could use it in production. This pushed us to explore **OSM and Here Maps** as more budget-friendly alternatives.

In my OJT, I also realized areas that needed improvement. For example, our mobile app’s **code structure wasn’t reusable**, and many components were redundant. I wanted to fix it, but unfortunately, my groupmates couldn’t assist since they weren’t familiar with how to refactor the code.

Despite the difficulties and burnout I experienced, this project was a **valuable and fun learning experience**. It showed me both the demands and rewards of being a Full Stack Developer. Most of all, it reminded me that I still have a lot of room to grow—especially in writing clean, reusable code and managing complexity in large projects.
